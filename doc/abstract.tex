\chapter*{Abstract}
In this thesis the main task is to solve the real-time communication between the sensory network and web based application. This is achieved by using standard communications TCP and UDP. The main component of this project is JavaScript server with Redis database, which provides exchange of information between end members of the network. These members consist of microcontrollers from STMicroelectronics, which are connected to the server via standard network elements and Ethernet. The result is a functional program, whose functionality was verified in practical network connection.
