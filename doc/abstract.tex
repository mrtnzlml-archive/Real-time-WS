\chapter*{Abstract}
The main task of this thesis is to solve the real-time communication between the sensory network and the web based application. It is achieved by using standard communications TCP and UDP. The main component of this thesis is JavaScript server with Redis database which provides exchanging of information between the end members of the network. These members are formed by microcontrollers from STMicroelectronics which are connected to the server via standard network elements and Ethernet. The result is a functional program which was verified by a practical network connection.
