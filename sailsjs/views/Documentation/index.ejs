        This document contains all necessary information about project internal and database structure. Feel free to
        update it&hellip;

    <h2>Database structure</h2>
    <p>There are four types of tables in the Redis at this moment:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>devices</code> is table of the <strong>set</strong> type intended for storing device's UID</li>
        <li>
            <code>device:xxx</code> where <em>xxx</em> is device name from <em>devices</em> table is table of the
            <strong>hash</strong> type intended for storing additional device
            information (specifically <em>ip</em>, <em>port</em>, <em>active</em> - status info, <em>msg_count</em> -
            only for this device, and <em>last_ping</em> - epoch time)
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>xxx:data</code> is table of the <strong>list</strong> type intended for storing device data history -
            at this moment this tables keeps last 1000 values from devices
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>connection:xxx</code> is table of the <strong>set</strong> as like as <em>devices</em> table - this
            table is intended for storing device connections to another devices - this is how devices know where to send
            data
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        There are also keys for storing additional information. At this moment there is <code>msg_count</code> which is
        for storing integer value of all requests sent through this server. This number should be much bigger than
        <code>msg_count</code> in the <code>device:xxx</code> table.
    </p>
